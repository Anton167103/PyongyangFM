Pyongyang FM â€” The Musical Voice of North Korea
Pyongyang FM is a unique radio station that broadcasts exclusively Korean music, primarily patriotic and revolutionary in nature.
Unlike other North Korean broadcasters such as Voice of Korea, Pyongyang FM does not feature news segments, political commentary, 
or foreign-language programming. It is a purely musical channel that reflects the aesthetic and ideological preferences of the DPRK.
