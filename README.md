Pyongyang FM â€” The Musical Voice of North Korea

Pyongyang FM is a unique radio station that broadcasts exclusively Korean music, primarily patriotic and revolutionary in nature.
Unlike other North Korean broadcasters such as Voice of Korea, Pyongyang FM does not feature news segments, political commentary, 
or foreign-language programming. It is a purely musical channel that reflects the aesthetic and ideological preferences of the DPRK.
Pyongyang FM emerged as part of the state media system aimed at cultural education of the population. Music plays a central 
role in shaping national consciousness in North Korea, and stations like Pyongyang FM serve as emotional instruments that complement
official propaganda.
